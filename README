Lift Filter for use with Cloudbees
==================================

When running a Lift application on Cloudbees the Lift run.mode will default to "development".  This servlet filter will set the run.mode based on the value set in the cloudbees-web.xml configuration, defaulting to development if not set.

This means a local jetty-run will default to development mode, but a Cloudbees deployment will default to production mode (or whatever value you put in the WEB-INF/cloudbees-web.xml file).

To use
======

 * Copy the src/main/scala/net.liftmodules.cloudbees.servlet/CloudBeesLiftFilter.scala into your project.
 * Modify the web.xml as per src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
 * Add a Cloudbees web configuration, based on  src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cloudbees-web.xml

You may need to add the Servlet API as a dependency in your project:
 "javax.servlet" % "servlet-api" % "2.5" % "provided->default"
   
Running this project
====================

This git repository contains a Lift application.  Run it via "sbt update jetty" and you'll see http://127.0.0.1:8080/ report "Your run mode is development".  

Run it via "bees app:run ./target/scala_2.8.1/cloudbees-lift-filter_2.8.1-1.0.war" and it'll report "Your run mode is Production".
